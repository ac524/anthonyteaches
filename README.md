# Anthony Teaches

The Anthony Teaches Project promotes Anthony as an educator through showcasing the post graduation success of students and providing free educational material and content around needs of bootcamp students. Project development focuses on collaborator education as we work together to learn post graduation technologies we build on, including SvelteKit, Github Actions, and deployment over CloudFlare Workers.

## Installation

npm run i
```

## VSCode Extensions

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
