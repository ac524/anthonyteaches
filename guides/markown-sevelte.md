# A Break Down of how to incorporate Markdown into Svelte

## Markdown
From the research I have completed, the main use for Markdown and Sveltekit is to use it for blogs.  There are many YouTube tutorials outlining how to complete an application on the web.   
## MDSveX 
MDX for Sveltekit.
Markdown preprocessor for Svelte components. Components are saved in ```.svx``` file.   

 ```npm i -D mdsvex```
## Installation 
``` npm i svelte-markdown ```
